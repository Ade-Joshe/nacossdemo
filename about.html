                <h3> So how did it all start... </h3>
                <p>
                    NACOSS was founded by groups of students in July 1993 with the backing of Nigerian Computer Society
                    (NCS) as its parent body. It provides avenues for students (in any IT related field) to highlight
                    and champion issues of interest in a coordinated and organized manner.
                    <br /><br />
                    NACOSS members (NACOSSites) are students studying in tertiary institutions in computer related
                    disciplines including: Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Information Technology, etc.
                    <br /><br />
                    Each member is essentially a member of the Association’s local chapter in his or her institution. As
                    of April 2012, NACOSS states that it is the largest and most organized student body in West Africa,
                    with registered members of about Two Hundred and Fifty thousand (250 000) in well over One Hundred
                    and fifty local chapters (and more unregistered) in different Institutions (Universities,
                    Polytechnics and Colleges of Education) across the six (6) Geo-political zones of Nigeria.

                <h3> Our Focus</h3>
                <p>Through consistent and professional exposure, NACOSS provides an excellent foundation for Computer
                    Scientists, Engineers and any IT related disciplines in Nigeria. Over the years, NACOSS has given to
                    the economy and society the finest professionals in Information and Communications Technology ICT
                    and is dedicated to doing even more in future.
                    <br /><br />
                    A study of NACOSS activities indicates that it reveals IT career and entrepreneurship opportunities
                    to the youth of Nigeria. It provides opportunities for them to explore and fulfill their potentials
                    and become more competitive in the IT environment locally and globally. It is about equipping young
                    people to become contributors and change agents in Nigeria through IT.
                    <br /><br />
                    When Nigeria youths are empowered and driven in the field of Computing and related areas, they drive
                    change in Nigeria and Africa, and they change the face of IT.

                    services and software to businesses, industry and the public.

                    software and services while also engaging participants and exhibitors positively.
